the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars
the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire
the voice of the lord is powerful
the voice of the lord is upon the waters
the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness
thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord
thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord
obey the voice of the lord your god
obey the voice of the lord thy god
obey the voice of the lord our god
i heard the voice of the lord
the voice of the screaming shopkeeper was loud
the voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent
tis the voice of the sluggard , said the gryphon
tis the voice of the lobster ; i heard him declare
hear the voice of the bard
the voice of the ancient bard
the voice of honest indignation is the voice of god
the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being
you'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
corporations , calculations , we're the voice of the new generation
but fuck all of that , the voice of the youth
the voice of the people , the real and the truth
the voice of the one who had nothin to lose
that's the voice of the kid , that's the kidnapper
they sayin i'm the voice of the young black youth
and i'm still the voice of the people , bro , and you ain't got 5 songs people know
it's the boys from the naka , it's the voice of the streets, boy
i shapeshift back into the voice of the people
the voice of the lord in my earlobe
the voice of the 702
i came from nothin to the voice of the streets
i would say the voice of the hood cause thats who i speak for
and be the voice of the illest
the voice of the announcer signing off
came from the streets we the voice of the youth
they know it's the voice of the hustle
with the voice of the mud strong heartbeat of dixie , motherfucker
i became the voice of the voiceless
the voice of god is government
