the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars
the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire
the voice of the lord is powerful
the voice of the lord is upon the waters
the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness
obey the voice of the lord
obey the voice of the lord your god
obey the voice of the lord thy god
obey the voice of the lord our god
